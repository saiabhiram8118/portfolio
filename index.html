                <h3>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h3>
                <p>Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology that prevents accidents when the driver is getting drowsy. The original aim of this project was to use the retinal reflection as a means of finding the eyes on the face, and then use the absence of this reflection as a way of detecting when the eyes are closed.</p>

                <h3>An Efficient Novel Approach for Early Detection of Child Attention Using Machine Learning Models Based on Facial Expressions</h3>
                <p>Determining the ability of children to focus at a very young age is something that is very important for adults to know for them to understand the child's learning capability. The development of their attention skills during their younger years affects how much excellence they can perform during their adolescence stage. Since most attention detection research is frequently done through eye gaze detection, this research is focused on detecting the attention of a child through facial expressions.</p>

                <h3>A Novel Machine Learning Algorithm for Spammer Identification in Industrial Mobile Cloud Computing</h3>
                <p>On the Internet of Things, an industrial mobile network is critical for industrial output. It ensures that machines work properly and that industrial production is consistent. Spammers, on the other hand, inflict harm on other people or interfere with business operations by taking advantage of this capability.</p>
